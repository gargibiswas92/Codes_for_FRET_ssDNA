# Codes_for_FRET_ssDNA
This codes are for calculating the time scale compatiable to the actual time.
From an experimental study 
 10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c00962  
 J Phys Chem Lett. 2021 May 20;12(19):4576-4584
 
 We took a 180 NT ssDNA
 Added contact among the last 5 beads:
 4-541
 7-538
 10-535
 13-532
 16-528
 The effective length of the loop is 170 NT
